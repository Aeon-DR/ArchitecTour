# 🏛️ Architectural Visualization – Unity Creative Core Project

Explore a realistic architectural scene built in Unity as part of Unity Learn’s [Creative Core](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/creative-core) pathway. 

## 🎮 About the Project

This project is a **desktop-based interactive walkthrough** of an architectural environment. It was designed to showcase a realistic space using Unity’s built-in features such as lighting, materials, VFX, and camera systems.

The goal was to apply and reinforce core Unity concepts through a real-world application, focusing on **visual fidelity**, **atmosphere**, and **user interaction**.
